- **Body Font**: "Inter" - Clean, readable sans-serif for content and UI elements
- **Code Font**: "JetBrains Mono" - Monospace for technical elements

### Visual Language
- **Geometric Precision**: Clean lines, perfect circles, and mathematical proportions
- **Liquid Motion**: Smooth, organic animations that feel natural and responsive
- **Depth Layering**: Strategic use of shadows and z-index to create visual hierarchy
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover effects and transitions that delight users

## Visual Effects & Styling

### 3D Elements
- **Floating Geometries**: Rotating cubes, spheres, and pyramids with metallic materials
- **Particle Systems**: Subtle floating particles that respond to user interaction
- **Shader Effects**: Custom WebGL shaders for background visual effects
- **Depth of Field**: Blur effects to focus attention on interactive elements

### Animation Library Usage
- **Anime.js**: Smooth property animations and staggered reveals
- **Matter.js**: Physics-based interactions for 3D objects
- **PIXI.js**: High-performance visual effects and particle systems
- **ECharts.js**: Data visualization for skills and project metrics

### Header Effects
- **Gradient Flow**: Animated gradient background that shifts based on scroll position
- **Parallax Layers**: Multiple background layers moving at different speeds
- **Typewriter Animation**: Hero text that types out with cursor effect
- **Color Cycling**: Text colors that cycle through the accent palette

### Interactive Elements
- **3D Tilt**: Cards and buttons that tilt in 3D space on hover
- **Glow Effects**: Subtle neon glow on interactive elements
- **Morphing Shapes**: Buttons that transform shape on interaction
- **Ripple Effects**: Click effects that radiate from the interaction point

## Layout & Composition

### Grid System
- **12-Column Grid**: Flexible layout system for all screen sizes
- **Golden Ratio**: Proportional spacing based on 1.618 ratio
- **Asymmetric Balance**: Dynamic layouts that feel organic yet structured

### Spacing & Rhythm
- **8px Base Unit**: All spacing derived from 8px increments
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Consistent line-height and margin relationships
- **Breathing Room**: Generous whitespace for content to shine

### Mobile-First Approach
- **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe, pinch, and tap interactions
- **Adaptive Typography**: Font sizes that scale smoothly across devices

## Gen-Z Aesthetic Elements

### Digital-Native Design
- **Meme Culture**: Subtle references to internet culture and humor
- **Glitch Effects**: Occasional digital distortion effects
- **Emoji Integration**: Strategic use of emojis in micro-copy
- **Social Proof**: Integration of social media elements and testimonials

### Authentic Personality
- **Behind-the-Scenes**: Showcasing the development process
- **Personal Branding**: Consistent visual identity across all elements
- **Storytelling**: Projects presented as narratives with conflict and resolution
- **Transparency**: Open about technologies used and challenges faced

This design approach creates a portfolio that feels both professionally credible and authentically Gen-Z - sophisticated enough for potential employers while maintaining the energy and creativity that defines your generation.
